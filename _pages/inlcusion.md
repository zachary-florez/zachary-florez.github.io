<h2>Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (<a href="https://shpe.org/" target="_blank">SHPE</a>)</h2>


SHPE is the largest association in the nation for Hispanics in STEM. SHPE changes lives by empowering the Hispanic community to realize its fullest potential and to impact the world through STEM awareness, access, support, and development. 

With the University of Arizona Chapter, and the Phoenix Professional Chapter, we host programs that are designed to raise awareness of and access to STEM among Hispanic communities. We also directly serve K-12, undergraduate, and adult men, and women with experience with up-to-date technology, and improve the retention of Hispanic Engineering and applied sciences students in Arizona.

SHPEâ€™s growth isnâ€™t slowing down anytime soon. As we continue to expand our membership, programs, and partnerships, weâ€™re guided by a clear mission, a bright vision, and the core values demonstrated by our founders.
