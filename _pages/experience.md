<h3><span style="color: #016FD0;"><a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #016FD0;">American Express</a></span> - Software Engineer</h3>

[August 2022 - Present]
* <u><i>Backend Software Engineer</i></u> on Global Merchant Accelerated Settlements - Payment Modernization working on our in-memory computing payment engine. 

* <b>2025 H1</b> - Reporting Standard. Applying a standard for all global reports by splitting up between business center and axiom paths so that the business can access specific and appropiate reports by market and region allowing them to follow the retention policy by market. Also enhancing readability and reducing the time spent searching through our current reports. 

* <b>2024 H2</b> - Direct Debit Processing for Europe, Middle Eastern, and Africa Markets. To collect for these market
specific merchant bank accounts, the banks and merchants need to be notified a couple days/week in advance that weâ€™ll be
collecting before we can proceed with our BAU Direct Debit Processing. I led the initial feature planning, designed user stories, SIT test cases, and aided with assigning stories to 3 new engineers and 2 new adjacent engineers, while also onboarding, going through daily build reviews, and teaching them the complexity of our payment engine.

* <b>2024 H1</b> - 1099K Operational Risk Event. For 1099k eligible payees, I designed and implemented a feature to prevent improper withholdings from global merchants, either certifying merchants based on a daily eligibility cache, or purging records that are in our pending system for longer than 4 years and 1 day. After the install in production, my code successfully certified/purged more than 8,000 pending payment records in our system after the first day.

* <b>2023</b> - Multicurrency. Modernized our current platform for global merchants to submit any currency in their payment files and either receive their total payable amounts in one currency or split it into multiple currencies.
