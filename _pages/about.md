My name is Zach, I'm currently a Software Engineer in Phoenix, Arizona. In my current role at Amex I work on modernizing payments for merchants globally, building solutions to complex features for our in-memory computing payment engine.


I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Arizona in 2022 and have been working in the field ever since.

I enjoy programming, learning, reading, playing sports, and staying active!
